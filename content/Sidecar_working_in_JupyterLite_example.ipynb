Or maybe something needs updating!!??! I first tried installing sidecar version 0.5.1 as it stated at [sidecar page there](https://beta.mamba.pm/channels/conda-forge/packages/sidecar), that I got when started from https://beta.mamba.pm/channels/conda-forge?tab=packages and searched 'sidecar'. That failed to build due to issue with Tornado version being too high according to log. And so I tried version sidecar version 0.7.0 because I had noted that at [the official conda-forge sidecar page at anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sidecar) clearly indicates 0.7.0 is for noarch and is the latest version (BUT OVER A YEAR OLD, so how out of date is that [sidecar page there](https://beta.mamba.pm/channels/conda-forge/packages/sidecar) saying 0.5.1 is latest!?!). And unpinning to let it presumably install the 0.70 version of sidecar worked to then allow it build & delploy and sidecar function in the JupyterLab interface in those JupyterLite sessions.",
